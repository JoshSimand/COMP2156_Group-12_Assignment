I really enjoy this class as the prof makes it fun enjoyable and easy to learn
I really like how he takes the time to make sure others are getting it right
This class made me really think more about what I wanan do for work
What learnt about Travis and the basic commands like git push git commit
I would reccomnd anyone taking this class
